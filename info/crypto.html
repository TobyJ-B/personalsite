    <h2>I currently hold two coins BTC and LINK</h2>
    <div class="Container">
      <h3>Why i hold Bitcoin</h3>
      <p>I hold Bitcoin because it grows in value. Its supply is finite, with only 21 million coins that can be produced, and it is currently being adopted by hundreds of institutions and brought into mainstream use. It's currently August 7, 2025, and I think we are still insanely early on it. It holds value better than fiat, and I think it will eventually replace it entirely. I fully believe in its technology, and my investing in it supports its growth.</p>

    <div class="Container">
      <h3> Why i hold LINK </h3>
      <p>Chainlink is one of the most underappreciated projects, and is pretty much unknown outside of crypto circles, im extremely bullish on this project and its potential is insane. What it does is bridge the gap between the blockchain and real world data, enabling smart contracts to access data not on the blockchain like price feeds and weather data among other things<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        This introduces a concept called Real World Assets(RWA). These are tokenized versions of bonds, real estate, equities and more. This allows these assets to be traded on the blockchain with instant settlement which is insane compared to the current wait of T+2 delay in our traditional financial system. This also allows you to trade any asset, any time 24/7 without having to wait for market open.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Chainlink is already partnered with massive instituions such as mastercard, J.P. Morgan and swift and it was also named in a new document by the whitehouse highlighting its importance as a key component of decentralized oracles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now this is cool and all but where does the $LINK token come into this? Link is used to pay the Chainlink node operators for delivering the secure, verified data to smart contracts. So the more usage of the network the more demand for LINK therefore a higher price
