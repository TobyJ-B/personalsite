      <h1>Three body problem review</h1>
      <p>I loved this book to death its the first book i have been completely stuck too in a while i think everybody should read this masterpiece and i am excited to read the next 2 books in the series. I have heard complaints of the characters falling flat and i disagree completely i loved every character and i thought it was way better than the show which i couldnt sit through due to it being boring and way worse than the book. I think i will need to reread this one to completely get it especially the last parts</p>
